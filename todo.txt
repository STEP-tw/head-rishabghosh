 ===== lib.js ===== 
line 99 function name could be better
* currently doesnot work for -n-5 filename and -n -5 filename
* arrangeContents - return fileList.map() could be better
* for args and inconsistence function
 * read files in head 
    - fs.readFileSync should read files in head and pass list to other function
 * move splitSource function in lib.js
 
head and tail function can be better
rename getContets, arrangeContents

====== util.js ======
missing tests for generateHeader
remove this

===== libTest.js =====
line 116 unused variables
line 281 misleading test ...why?
line 323 - 344 filePath should be fileName

===== directory =====
poor file names
